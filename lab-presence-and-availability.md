# Lab Presence and Availability

## Group Members

It is expected that all research group members will work consistently on their research and remain in communication and collaboration with the broader group. This includes:
* Applying consistent and professional effort to your research;
* Sharing ideas and effort with your fellow lab members;
* Attending meetings (physically or remotely) with me, the broader lab, or any other research groups;
* Staying in communication via email or Slack.
* Maintaining some physical presence in the lab, although hybrid remote work plans are ok. Please just discuss with me first.  

Note that there is no expectation that members of the lab work unreasonable hours or staff holidays, but you are expected to work during non-staff university breaks unless on vacation or taking personal time. To help develop a healthy work-life balance:

* **Set boundaries each day**: Define what work hours make sense for you and turn off notifications during your personal time.
* **Take time off each week**: Take a day or two off, as needed, each week.
* **Stay at home if you’re sick**: Your health comes first – work can wait. Just let me know when you can so I don’t bother you. 
* **Taking vacations**: Group members should aim to take time off each year for vacation. Accordingly to Cornell policy, graduate students are entitled to 2 weeks (10 weekdays) off per year, while postdocs and research associates are entitled to 3 weeks (15 weekdays) off per year. I can be flexible with vacation times and durations. Please just discuss vacation timelines with me and communicate them to the rest of the lab. It’s helpful to set away messages and e-mail responses which make it clear that you are on vacation.

## Principal Investigator

I will be regularly working on campus unless on leave. I will be available to meet weekly with all members of the group for 1 hour each week, in addition to the group meeting. In addition, I will always try to respond to emails and questions within 48 hours, although during particularly busy times this might not be possible.   

If you want to ask a question or schedule an impromptu meeting and my office door (320 Riley-Robb Hall) is open, feel free to ask if I can meet with you. If my door is closed, I am likely unavailable at that time. In those instances, please send a message to schedule a meeting at another time. 

You can text me if you need an immediate response to something, and I will respond as soon as I can. Also, you can call in case of any emergency. 

I will make my vacation plans clear ahead of time, so that any relevant deadlines requiring feedback can be dealt with prior to the start.
