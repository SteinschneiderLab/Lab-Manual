# Roles, Responsibilities, and Expectations
Below are listed the main roles, responsibilities, and expectations for different members of the lab, which are designed to promote a healthy, fun, and productive environment. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask.

## Everyone

* **Scientific Integrity**: It is never, ever okay to commit scientific misconduct. There will be a zero-tolerance policy towards fabrication, falsification, and plagiarism. Alert me if you are concerned about any research practices you observe. 
*	**Open Science**: As a lab, we are committed to the principles of open, transparent, and reproducible science. More details on our approach to openness are provided below, but all group members will make their models, data, and code publicly available and easily accessible.
*	**Respectfulness**: We expect that you will treat every other member of the lab, as well as everyone else, with respect. We want to create an environment where everybody, regardless of background and personality, feels comfortable and valued. In addition, there is zero tolerance for harassment of any kind, which is expressed in the lab’s statement on harassment below: 

*The Steinschneider Research Group is committed to creating a harassment-free space for everyone, regardless of race, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, age, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of group members, other colleagues, or anyone else in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any professional setting, including talks, workshops, or any online media. Research group members violating these rules will be sanctioned or expelled at my discretion.*

*If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, contact me immediately. I am always available any time to help group members contact security or local law enforcement, navigate official University reporting channels, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe in the research environment. If I am the cause of your concern or you would prefer I not be involved, official concerns can be directed to the Diversity and Inclusion office or the Title IX Coordinator.*


## Principal Investigator

* Build an inclusive and equitable environment: While every member of the research group is expected to contribute to a positive and inclusive environment, it is ultimately my responsibility to manage the social dynamic of the group.

* Provide the research environment and funding: It’s my job to provide and managing hardware and software resources to facilitate the group’s research is my job. It’s also my responsibility to obtain funding for research equipment, personnel, and other costs such as travel, conference expenses, and publication fees. One of my top priorities is to ensure everyone has sufficient funding. You are never expected to spend your personal finances on anything related to research. 

* Provide mentoring, feedback, and support: It’s my job to help junior researchers in the group mature into independent scientists. This will include providing guidance, feedback, and moral support on all aspects of research, course selection, and career goals.

* Write recommendations: I will write an honest recommendation letter for you at any point. If you need a recommendation letter, please give me any required information with a few weeks advance notice. If you have been away from the group for some time, I will likely ask you for some additional information to help write the letter.

### Research Associates and Postdocs

Postdocs and research associates should be focused on transitioning into independent researchers. This does not mean working without guidance or supervision, but rather developing the ability to formulate and pursue independent lines of research.

* Publish and present research: Your primarily role is to produce research. You are expected to be able independently conduct research, write publication-quality articles, and develop clear and compelling presentations for seminars and conferences. However, I will always provide feedback and support you as you develop these skills.

* Co-develop group research and mentoring: You should take an active role in helping to improve and develop the research group. This includes developing your own research ideas, supporting the development of proposals, and providing mentorship and training to graduate and undergraduate students. 

* Develop a career plan: You should take an active role in developing a career plan, including what types of jobs you are interested in, how you might want to prepare for those roles, and that you discuss those plans with me so that I can effectively mentor you.


## Graduate Students

The goal of graduate school is to learn to become a researcher and/or to develop advanced professional skills beyond an undergraduate degree. This will require balancing several responsibilities.

* Be organized: Grad school is full of requirements and demands on your time. Make sure that you develop a time management system that works to manage your responsibilities, both research and coursework, while allowing sufficient time off to rest. You are also responsible for staying on top of requirements of your degree program, including required courses, credits, and exam dates. I will support you in this, but you must communicate with me about any upcoming deadlines or needs.

* Develop a research plan: As a grad student, you are learning how to do research, or an equivalent type of professional work. For students pursuing a research degree (M.S. or Ph.D.), it is your responsibility to develop a research plan to work towards your degree. I will support you throughout this process, but you must take ownership on your research projects. This includes learning how to formulate interesting research questions, developing effective experimental designs, executing those designs, analyzing results, and drawing conclusions that help to answer the research questions. It is expected that we will work collaboratively in this process and that your research plan will evolve over time, but you should be consistently working towards developing yourself as an independent researcher. For students in professional programs (M.Eng.), your project is a key part of your overall experience. You should prioritize this work and treat it professionally.

* Succeed in your coursework: Depending on your program, there are periods in grad school that are dominated by coursework. You should try to get as much from your coursework as possible while meeting your other responsibilities. However, coursework is only part of a graduate program and should be seen as complementary to (rather than a priority over) your research or project-based work. 

* Develop a career plan: Please think carefully about what type of job you would like to have, and what training you need to best prepare you for your ambitions. I will do everything I can to support you in your career goals, but only you can develop those goals. This plan is likely to be dynamic, which is totally fine!
