# Steinschneider Group Lab Manual

This repository contains documents that detail procedures, expectations, and resources that apply to all members of the lab. The lab manual should be considered a living set of documents. Any lab member should feel free to comment or make recommendations on how this manual can be improved. 

## What We Do

Work in the Steinschneider Lab enhances the sustainability of water systems through innovations in climate risk management that enable decision-making under deep uncertainty in future climate and hydrologic conditions. We advance this program through three inter-related themes: 
* **T1: Assessing the variability, predictability, and change of hydroclimate processes that impact the performance of water infrastructure.**
* **T2: Developing data-driven and process-based models to quantify the risk these hydroclimate processes pose to water services.**
* **T3: Identifying robust adaptation strategies that can mitigate this risk.**
 
We pursue this agenda across scales, with two primary focal points: 1) hydroclimate forecasts for short-term management (days-months); and 2) long-term planning under climate change (years-decades). 

Areas in which we work: 

* *Profiling causal mechanisms of flood and drought risk*
* *Paleo-climate reconstructions*
* *Subseasonal-to-seasonal hydroclimate forecasting*
* *Stochastic weather generation and climate scenario development*
* *Synthetic forecasts and forecast-informed reservoir operations*
* *Robust and dynamic water system adaptation under climate change*
* *Streamflow estimation in ungauged basins*
* *Machine learning and uncertainty analysis in hydrology and water management*

## Roles, Responsibilities, and Expectations
