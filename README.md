# Steinschneider Group Lab Manual

This repository contains materials that detail procedures, expectations, and resources that apply to all members of the Steinschneider Lab. These include:

* An overview of [research](what-we-do.md) conducted in the Steinschneider Lab
* The [roles, responsibility, and expectations](roles-responsibilities-expectations.md) for different members in the lab 
* Guidelines on [professional and skillset development](professional-development.md)
* Lab policy on [availability, time off, and remote work](lab-presence-and-availability.md)
* Lab policy on [open research](open-research.md)
* Other [resources](resources)

The lab manual should be considered a set of living documents. Feel free to comment or make recommendations on how this manual can be improved. 

Finally, I would be remiss not to thank Vivek Srikrishnan and Pat Reed for sharing their own lab manuals, which provided much of the inspiration for how this one is designed.
