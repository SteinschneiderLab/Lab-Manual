# Professional Development

All members of the lab are expected to continually develop themselves as scientists. This will involve staying up to date on the most recent advances in your sub-field(s) of interest, developing the tools necessary to conduct compelling research, and learning how to communicate your work to a range of audiences. Some guidance on each of these components is provided below. 

* **Scientific Literacy**: You need to exert a consistent effort to stay on top of the scientific literature in your particular area(s) of interest. Towards this end, my recommendation is to read at least 2-3 papers a week. You should start with papers written by members of the lab, collaborating research groups, and key papers cited in those papers. Then use content alerts and browsing to stay current (e.g., alerts via Google Scholar). Discuss papers with your colleagues. Closely follow the work of those you admire and people who are good content watchdogs. I also strongly suggest you use a reference management (e.g., Mendeley) to organize the literature you read. Create an organization system in that reference manager that works for you. 

* **Computer Programming and Advanced Toolkits**: Our work is mostly computational in nature, and so we need to develop strong programming skills. While I do not require any one particular language, I recommend starting with Python or R depending on the nature of your work. You will also want to learn shell scripting as you become more advanced in your programming. 

  I am happy to provide support as you develop your programming skills. In particular, I will fund online training modules (e.g., Data Camp) if you want to pick up a new language. I also require that students use Git and Github for version control and to promote open science (see [open-science](open-science.md)). 

  The lab often uses high performance computing (HPC) in support of our research. We have a local cluster (Hopper), and also use cloud resources (NSF ACCESS; Google cloud, Amazon Cloud Platform, Amazon Web Services). You can learn from peers in the lab and the broader EWRS community how to use these resources.  

  I have compiled several tutorials and other resources in the [resources](resources) folder of the lab manual. Please start there and read through those materials as a useful starting place for training excercises. 

  Coursework is also an important way to develop new skills and expand the breadth and depth of your knowledge. Courses should be chosen carefully to complement the skills and knowledge you wish to develop in support of your research. In a separate [repository] (https://github.com/vuejs/vue) in the lab Github account, we have developed a course list (branched from Vivek's lab) that can provide a good place to start when thinking through which courses to take. 

* **Communication**: It is critically important that you learn how to communicate your work to a range of audiences. You will be given many opportunities to practice your presentation skills, including in group meetings, EWRS seminars, and professional conferences. It is expected that you will take advantage of these. I highly encourage that you use slide deck templates developed in the lab as a way to increase the professionalism of your presentations. In addition, you should work to develop your skills as a scientific writer. The following reference is a great place to start (see [resources](resources) folder):
