# Open and Reproducible Research

* Our research group is committed to producing open and reproducible science by using and producing open-source and reproducible tools, and communicating our work through open-access channels.

* Group members are required to share any data and code used in the development of a paper. This does not have to happen immediately, but public release should generally occur by the time we are ready to submit a manuscript for peer-review. We often use Github and Zenodo for this. Every lab member should have and manage their own account. See [here](git-and-github.md) for more detail. 

* Your entire analysis, from model calibration to figure generation, should be made public and organized in a straightforward fashion. All code and data needed to reproduce your work should be included. You should also include partial products of the analysis, such as calibration and simulation results, so that subsequent parts of the analysis can be reproduced without needing to re-run everything from scratch.
* The following article is a great place to start to learn about best practices (see [resources](resources) folder):

* To increase access of results to the scientific community, we will: 
  * post preprints on an open-access preprint server at the time of submission
  * publish in open-access journals (or with open-access licenses) where possible and appropriate, and make post-prints readily available when not.
  * clearly document and organize code in online repositories;
  * make code repositories publicly available at time of submission.
