# Command Line Tutorials

## How to access the command line

* Mac OS X: Go to /Applications/Utilities and click on "Terminal" or search for "Terminal" in Spotlight.

* Desktop Linux: You can search for the "Terminal" application from the Dash. Let's be honest, though, if you're running Linux, you probably don't need this tutorial.

* Windows: You need to install Cygwin, which will allow you to mimic a Linux-style command line:

A version of command line can also be accessed through the Start Menu, but this is a Windows version has its own system, and so the Linux-style command line through Cygwin is often more useful.
