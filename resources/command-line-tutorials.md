# Command Line Tutorials

## Why learn command line?
There are several reasons to learn how to code using the command line. One of the most important is that high performance computing (HPC) clusters are almost always run on a Linux operating system, which uses commmand line to navigate around the system. You can also use command line to run models written in multiple other programs in sequence, given you more control over your workflow. 

## How to access the command line

* Mac OS X: Go to /Applications/Utilities and click on "Terminal".

* Windows: You need to install [Cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com/), which will allow you to mimic a Linux-style command line. A version of command line can also be accessed through the Start Menu, but this is a Windows version that has its own system, and so the Linux-style command line through Cygwin is often more useful.  

* Desktop Linux: You can search for the "Terminal" application from the Dash.
