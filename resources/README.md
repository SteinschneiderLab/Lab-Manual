# Resources
This folder contains useful resources for members of the lab, including: 
* a guide to scientific writing (Day 1998, How to write and publish a scientific paper)
* a guide to best practices for computational science (Wilson et al. 2017, Good enough practices in scientific computing.pdf)
* [basics](command-line-tutorials.md) on how to code in command line
* a simple [introduction](git-and-github.md) to Git and Guthub
* a [guide](high-performance-computing.md) to high performance computing resources
* a [primer](get-started-with-coding-in-python.md) on how to get started (the right way0 with coding in Python, including directory organization for your projects, Python installation, and virtual environments

Also, the [Water Programming blog](https://waterprogramming.wordpress.com/) out of the Reed Research group has a tremendous wealth of how-to information for a variety of programming and modeling tasks relevant to our work. I strongly encourage you to use this blog as a core training resource.
