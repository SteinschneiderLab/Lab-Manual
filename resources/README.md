# Resources
This folder contains useful resources for members of the lab, including: 
* a guide to scientific writing (Day 1998, How to write and publish a scientific paper)
* a guide to best practices for computational science (Wilson et al. 2017, Good enough practices in scientific computing.pdf)
* [basics](command-line-tutorials.md) on how to code in command line
* a simple [introduction](git-and-github.md) to Git and Guthub
* a [guide](high-performance-computing.md) to high performance computing resources

Also, [here](https://waterprogramming.wordpress.com/) is a link to the Water Programming blog out of the Reed Research group, which has a tremendous wealth of how-to information for a variety of programming and modeling tasks relevant to our work.
