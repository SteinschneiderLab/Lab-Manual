# High Performance Computing

We often require high performance computing (HPC) to our research conduct. There are a few HPC resources that lab members have access to: 

## Hopper
Hopper is a cluster run by Vivek Srikrishnan in BEE and shared across the Srikrishnan, Steinschneider, Reed, and Anderson groups. To get access to Hopper, email Vivek Srikrishnan and provide your name, email, address, and phone number so that he can register you as a user. You will get an email with your login information and a notice to set a password.

Specs on Hopper can be found [here](https://www.cac.cornell.edu/wiki/index.php?title=Hopper_Cluster)

## Accessing Hopper

### Windows 
The easiest way to remote into the above clusters if you are a Windows user is to download MobaXterm [here](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/). Start the local terminal and then ssh into the terminal as in the following image, but using you own username.

### Mac
If you use a Mac, you can immediately ssh into the clusters without having to download MobaXterm since Macs have Terminal. However, you may find that itâ€™s harder to navigate just using the command line. Students who use Macs often pair their terminal use with [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io/), which can serve as the SFTP.

## NSF ACCESS
