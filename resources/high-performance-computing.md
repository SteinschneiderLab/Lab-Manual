# High Performance Computing

We often require high performance computing (HPC) to our research conduct. There are a few HPC resources that lab members have access to: 

## Hopper
Hopper is a cluster run by Vivek Srikrishnan in BEE and shared across the Srikrishnan, Steinschneider, Reed, and Anderson groups. To get access to Hopper, email Vivek Srikrishnan and provide your name, email, address, and phone number so that he can register you as a user. You will get an email with your login information and a notice to set a password.

Specs on Hopper can be found [here](https://www.cac.cornell.edu/wiki/index.php?title=Hopper_Cluster)

## Some useful terminology
* **SSH**: SSH or Secure Shell is a network communication protocol that enables two computers to communicate and share data in a client-server model. SSH is often used to "login" and perform operations on remote computers, but it may also be used for transferring data.

* **SSH client**: An SSH client is a program that allows establishing secure and authenticated SSH connections to SSH servers.

* **SSH server**: An SSH server is a software program which uses the Secure Shell protocol to accept connections from remote computers. 

* **SFTP**:  The SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) is a network protocol that provides file access, file transfer, and file management. SFTP is a popular use case for an SSH server.

## Accessing Hopper

Tutorials on how to access Hopper can be found here. However, there are slight differences depending on your operating system:

### Windows 
The easiest way to remote into Hopper if you are a Windows user is to download MobaXterm [here](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/). 

### Mac
If you use a Mac, you can immediately ssh into the clusters without having to download MobaXterm since Macs have Terminal. However, you may find that itâ€™s harder to navigate just using the command line. Students who use Macs often pair their terminal use with [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io/), which can serve as the SFTP.
