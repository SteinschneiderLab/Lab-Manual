# High Performance Computing

We often require high performance computing (HPC) to our research conduct. There are a few HPC resources to which lab members have access. 

## Hopper
Hopper is a cluster run by Vivek Srikrishnan in BEE and shared across the Srikrishnan, Steinschneider, Reed, and Anderson groups. To get access to Hopper, email Vivek Srikrishnan and provide your name, email, address, and phone number so that he can register you as a user. You will get an email with your login information and a notice to set a password.

Specs on Hopper can be found [here](https://www.cac.cornell.edu/wiki/index.php?title=Hopper_Cluster)

### Some useful terminology
* **SSH**: SSH or Secure Shell is a network communication protocol that enables two computers to communicate and share data in a client-server model. SSH is often used to "login" and perform operations on remote computers, but it may also be used for transferring data.

* **SSH client**: An SSH client is a program that allows establishing secure and authenticated SSH connections to SSH servers.

* **SSH server**: An SSH server is a software program which uses the Secure Shell protocol to accept connections from remote computers (i.e., the client). 

* **SFTP**:  The SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) is a network protocol that provides file access, file transfer, and file management. SFTP is a popular extension of SSH to provide secure file transfer capabilities.

### Accessing Hopper

Hopper access is shared amongst 4 research groups, so responsible use of the resource is critical. Hopper jobs should be scheduled via the Hopper Demand Log [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WP6kUm3_G9lEADBo81xXcw8yPdmLu6J85PZb-V3xnl0/edit?usp=sharing). There are also some very useful 'Getting started with Hopper' kinds of guides embedded in this document as well as at the Srikrishnan Group GitHub site [here](https://github.com/srikrishnan-lab/slurm_tutorial). The notes below regarding OS dependent access briefly summarize some considerations for Hopper use that are covered in more detail in the aforementioned resources:

#### Windows 
The easiest way to remote into Hopper if you are a Windows user is to download MobaXterm [here](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/). 

#### Mac
If you use a Mac, you can immediately ssh into the clusters without having to download MobaXterm since Macs have Terminal. However, you may find that itâ€™s harder to navigate just using the command line. Students who use Macs often pair their terminal use with [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io/), which can serve as the SFTP.
