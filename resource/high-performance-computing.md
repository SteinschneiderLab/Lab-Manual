# High Performance Computing

We often require high performance computing (HPC) to our research conduct. There are a few HPC resources that lab members have access to: 

## Hopper
Hopper is a cluster run by Vivek Srikrishnan in BEE and shared across the Srikrishnan, Steinschneider, Reed, and Anderson groups. To get access to Hopper, email Vivek Srikrishnan and provide your name, email, address, and phone number so that he can register you as a user. You will get an email with your login information and a notice to set a password.

Specs on Hopper can be found [here](https://www.cac.cornell.edu/wiki/index.php?title=Hopper_Cluster)

## NSF ACCESS
