# Roles, Responsibilities, and Expectations

Below are listed the main roles, responsibilities, and expectations for different members of the lab, which are designed to promote a healthy, fun, and productive environment. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask.

## Everyone

* **Scientific Integrity**: It is never, ever okay to commit scientific misconduct. There will be a zero-tolerance policy towards fabrication, falsification, and plagiarism. Alert me if you are concerned about any research practices you observe. 
* **Open Science**: As a lab, we are committed to the principles of open, transparent, and reproducible science. More details on our approach to openness are provided below, but all group members will make their models, data, and code publicly available and easily accessible.
* **Respectfulness**: We expect that you will treat every other member of the lab, as well as everyone else, with respect. We want to create an environment where everybody, regardless of background and personality, feels comfortable and valued. In addition, there is zero tolerance for harassment of any kind, which is expressed in the lab’s statement on harassment below: 

*The Steinschneider Research Group is committed to creating a harassment-free space for everyone, regardless of race, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, age, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of group members, other colleagues, or anyone else in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any professional setting, including talks, workshops, or any online media. Research group members violating these rules will be sanctioned or expelled at my discretion.*

*If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, contact me immediately. I am always available any time to help group members contact security or local law enforcement, navigate official University reporting channels, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe in the research environment. If I am the cause of your concern or you would prefer I not be involved, official concerns can be directed to the Diversity and Inclusion office or the Title IX Coordinator.*

## Principal Investigator

* **Build an inclusive and equitable environment**: While every member of the research group is expected to contribute to a positive and inclusive environment, it is ultimately my responsibility to manage the social dynamic of the group.

* **Provide the research environment and funding**: It’s my job to provide and managing hardware and software resources to facilitate the group’s research is my job. It’s also my responsibility to obtain funding for research equipment, personnel, and other costs such as travel, conference expenses, and publication fees. One of my top priorities is to ensure everyone has sufficient funding. You are never expected to spend your personal finances on anything related to research. 

* **Provide mentoring, feedback, and support**: It’s my job to help junior researchers in the group mature into independent scientists. This will include providing guidance, feedback, and moral support on all aspects of research, course selection, and career goals.

* **Write recommendations**: I will write an honest recommendation letter for you at any point. If you need a recommendation letter, please give me any required information with a few weeks advance notice. If you have been away from the group for some time, I will likely ask you for some additional information to help write the letter.
