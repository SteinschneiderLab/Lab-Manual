#### README  
This training module contains a .pdf presentation, some data, and instructor notes to accomplish introductory training on LINUX/command line. The instructor notes follow the presentation and provide useful code snippets to run as part of 
the presentation.
  
As preparation for this module, it is recommended that students quickly review the introductory slides of the presentation (slides 1-10) and ensure that they have a GitHub account and git installed on their machine to be able to fully 
participate in the hands-on training. Further information on this can be found in the git training module [here](../git). This will be their first formal exposure to git in the group training regimen and the purpose of introducing it prior to the actual git lesson is 1) ensure that they clear up any logistical issues with git (account, installation, etc) and 2) allow them to clone the training modules to their local machine for this and future lessons.
